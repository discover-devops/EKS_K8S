## **1️ What is Ingress?**

* An **Ingress** is a **Kubernetes API object**.
* It defines **rules** for how external HTTP/HTTPS traffic should reach **Services** inside the cluster.
* Example rules:

  * **Host-based routing:** `app1.example.com` → `svc-app1`
  * **Path-based routing:** `example.com/app2` → `svc-app2`
* Ingress is like a **traffic rulebook**. It **does not process traffic itself**.

---

## **2️ What is an Ingress Controller?**

* An **Ingress Controller** is the **actual software component** that implements the rules defined in Ingress.
* It watches the Kubernetes API for Ingress objects and configures a **reverse proxy / load balancer** accordingly.
* Common controllers:

  * **NGINX Ingress Controller** (open source, runs inside cluster)
  * **AWS Load Balancer Controller** (provisions ALB/NLB in AWS)
  * **HAProxy, Traefik, Istio Gateway** (alternatives)

 So:

* **Ingress (object)** = *“What should happen?”* (rules)
* **Ingress Controller** = *“How it actually happens”* (engine that enforces rules)

---

## **3️ Why do we need it?**

Without Ingress:

* Each Service `type: LoadBalancer` → its **own external LB** (expensive, messy).

With Ingress:

* **One Load Balancer + Ingress Controller** → routes traffic to **many Services** inside cluster.
* Saves **cost**, simplifies **DNS management**, enables **TLS termination** and **HTTP features** (rewrite, redirects, auth).

---

## **4️ How does it work internally?**

Step-by-step flow:

1. **Client → DNS/LB**

   * User accesses `app1.example.com` or `example.com/app2`.
   * DNS points to the **LoadBalancer** (e.g., AWS ELB).
   * This LoadBalancer forwards all traffic to the Ingress Controller Pod(s).

2. **Ingress Controller**

   * Runs as a Deployment/DaemonSet inside Kubernetes.
   * Watches Ingress objects.
   * Dynamically configures its proxy (e.g., NGINX) to apply rules.

3. **Routing to Services**

   * Based on Ingress rules, traffic is routed to the correct **Service**.
   * The Service then load-balances traffic across backend **Pods**.

```

* **Ingress Object:** defines routing rules (e.g., `/app1`, `/app2`)
* **Ingress Controller:** enforces rules and manages proxy configuration
* **One LB → Many Services**

 **Summary for students**

* **Ingress = Rulebook** (how to route traffic)
* **Ingress Controller = Traffic Cop** (applies rules using a proxy)
* **Benefit:** One entry point for multiple apps, cheaper, flexible, production-ready.
