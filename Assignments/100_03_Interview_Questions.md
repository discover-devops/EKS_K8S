Here’s a comprehensive list of **Kubernetes interview questions** divided into **four parts** based on complexity and context:

---

### **Part #1: Straightforward and Basic Questions**
These questions test fundamental Kubernetes knowledge.

1. What is Kubernetes, and why is it used?
2. Explain the Kubernetes architecture and its core components.
3. What is a Pod in Kubernetes? Can a Pod have multiple containers?
4. What is the difference between a ReplicaSet and a Deployment?
5. How does a Kubernetes Service work? Explain the different types of Services.
6. What is the purpose of a Namespace in Kubernetes?
7. What is the role of the `kube-apiserver` in Kubernetes?
8. How does the `kube-scheduler` decide where to place a pod?
9. What is the difference between `kubectl apply` and `kubectl create`?
10. Explain the role of a ConfigMap and a Secret.
11. What is the purpose of a PersistentVolume (PV) and a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)?
12. What is an Ingress resource in Kubernetes?
13. How does Kubernetes handle resource requests and limits for containers?
14. What is the purpose of the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)?
15. How does the Cluster Autoscaler differ from HPA?

### **Part #2: Medium-Level Questions and Troubleshooting**
These questions delve deeper into Kubernetes concepts and include light troubleshooting scenarios.

1. How would you troubleshoot a Pod stuck in a **Pending** state?
2. How can you debug a Pod stuck in a **CrashLoopBackOff** state?
3. How do you check the logs of a container running in a Pod?
4. What is the difference between `kubectl logs` and `kubectl exec`?
5. How can you list all the Pods running in a specific Namespace?
6. What is a DaemonSet, and when would you use it?
7. Explain the difference between a StatefulSet and a Deployment.
8. How does Kubernetes achieve high availability for Pods?
9. What is the purpose of a ServiceAccount in Kubernetes?
10. How can you roll back a Deployment in Kubernetes?
11. How do you configure a Pod to access an external database securely?
12. What is `kube-proxy`, and how does it manage networking in Kubernetes?
13. A Pod cannot communicate with another Pod in the same cluster. How would you troubleshoot this?
14. What is a Kubernetes Admission Controller, and how does it work?
15. How do you handle SSL termination in Kubernetes using Ingress?

### **Part #3: Scenario-Based Questions**
These questions assess problem-solving abilities in real-world Kubernetes scenarios.

1. You have a microservice-based application where some services are not accessible. How would you troubleshoot the issue?
2. Your Deployment has scaled up to 10 replicas, but some replicas are not running. What steps would you take to diagnose the problem?
3. You deployed an application, but it cannot connect to an external API. How would you debug this?
4. Your Pods are getting terminated due to resource constraints. How would you resolve this issue?
5. A developer accidentally deleted a Namespace with running applications. What steps can you take to recover?
6. Your application needs to support zero-downtime deployments. How would you configure Kubernetes to achieve this?
7. A StatefulSet database cluster has one Pod that is not starting due to volume issues. How would you debug and fix it?
8. Your cluster's node utilization is consistently high, and Pods are getting evicted. How would you address this problem?
9. How would you configure Kubernetes to deploy a web application with an internal Redis cache and an external MySQL database?
10. A high-traffic Ingress route is causing the application to slow down. What steps would you take to optimize performance?

---

### **Part #4: System Design Questions**
These questions evaluate the candidate’s ability to design systems using Kubernetes.

1. Design a highly available and scalable architecture for a web application using Kubernetes.
2. How would you design a CI/CD pipeline that deploys containerized applications on a Kubernetes cluster?
3. Design a multi-tenant Kubernetes cluster for a SaaS application. How would you ensure tenant isolation?
4. How would you configure Kubernetes to handle a multi-region deployment with failover and disaster recovery?
5. Design a system to deploy and scale a stateful application like Kafka or MySQL using Kubernetes.
6. How would you implement application monitoring and logging in Kubernetes? What tools would you use?
7. Describe the architecture of a Kubernetes cluster that uses microservices, including Ingress, Services, and Autoscalers.
8. How would you implement Kubernetes to support a hybrid cloud setup with on-premise and cloud components?
9. Design a Kubernetes-based architecture for an IoT application where edge devices send data to the cloud.
10. How would you design a Kubernetes-based system that supports canary deployments and rolling updates with traffic splitting?
